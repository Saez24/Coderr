# Coderr ‚Äì Freelancer Developer Platform

**Coderr** is a backend-first project for a freelancer developer platform.  
While the frontend team has already built the interface, your task is to implement all backend functionality and seamlessly integrate it with the frontend.

This repository acts as a central meta-repository combining both the frontend and backend via Git submodules.
